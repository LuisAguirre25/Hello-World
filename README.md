This is a sample of a good README.md file that can be used when describing a project.  You can change the headings to fit your needs, but the idea is to provide a summary of the project, the files used, programs written and how to execute the program.  Think of this as documentation.

# Table of contents

# **Project Title**

*First Project:* *Hello World Sample* 

### Description

Practice using GitHub by creating a sample repository. Make sure you add a description to help others understand your project.

### **How to Run Program** 

Explain here how you would run the program and what files need to be available. 
```text
Hello_World/
└── 
    │── README.md
    │── pgmname1.R
    │── filename1.csv
    │── examples.html
   
```

### **Files Used** 

1. Did you use any datafiles?  
2. List filenames
3. Where you got them 
4. What is contained within the data files?
5. Datafile considerations 
6. URL links to files - example here:
[Baby names from 1880 to present](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data)

### Versioning

Discuss any versioning used especially if you are making major changes throughout the process of your code.
